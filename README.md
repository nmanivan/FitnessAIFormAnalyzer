# VisualFormDetectionAI
Detect form and technique flaws for fitness enthusiasts.

Below I've outlined an example MVP

1. Define the Core MVP Scope
Goal: Allow users to upload a fitness video and receive feedback on form.

Key MVP Features:
📹 Video Upload: User uploads or records a video (e.g., squats, push-ups, deadlifts).

🧠 Pose Estimation: Use a pre-trained model to extract body landmarks (OpenPose, MediaPipe, or MoveNet).

📝 Form Detection Logic: Compare pose data to ideal templates to detect:

Knees over toes

Back rounding

Elbow angle during push-ups

🧑‍⚕️ Feedback System: Return clear, visual or text feedback (e.g., “Lean too far forward in squat at 00:05”).

📊 Basic UI: Simple web or mobile interface to test flow end-to-end.

🛠️ 2. Tech Stack Recommendations
Layer	Tech Suggestions
Frontend	React or SwiftUI (depending on web or iOS)
Backend	Python (FastAPI or Flask)
AI Model	MediaPipe, OpenPose, or MoveNet
Storage	Firebase or AWS S3 (for video storage)
Deployment	Vercel, Render, or AWS EC2

🚧 3. Build Plan (4–6 weeks)
Week 1: Discovery & Design
✅ Define supported exercises (e.g., squats, push-ups)

🎨 Create simple UI/UX wireframes

📁 Set up repo, CI/CD pipeline, and cloud storage

Week 2–3: Pose Detection + Video Processing
Integrate pose estimation model (e.g., MediaPipe)

Parse joint angle and movement over time

Normalize for camera position, user height if possible

Week 4: Build the Feedback Engine
Encode rule-based form flaws (e.g., "if knee passes toe by > X pixels, flag error")

Map timestamps to flaws

Optionally annotate frames with red/yellow markers

Week 5: Frontend + Feedback Integration
Upload video > Trigger AI > Show results

Overlay visual indicators or textual feedback

Week 6: Testing & Deployment
Try 5-10 sample user videos

Tune error thresholds and feedback quality

Deploy and share for early user feedback

🧠 Future Features (Post-MVP)
Real-time feedback via webcam

Personalized progress tracking

Support for multiple angles (multi-camera setup)

Integration with wearables or heart rate data

Community/social feed for peer feedback

📈 Suggested Metrics to Track
Time to analyze a video

Accuracy of form error detection (qualitative early on)

User satisfaction score

Daily active users
